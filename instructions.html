			<h1>WEB234 Final Project Requirements (Spring 2016)</h1>

			<p>The purpose of the final project is to allow you to demonstrate the skills you’ve learned in WEB234 by creating a responsive web site or single-page web application of your choosing. The project can be based on any class-appropriate topic, but MUST be approved by the instructor first. Suggested topics for the project include: hobbies, family sites, small business/portfolio sites, conceptual client sites, small web applications, etc. Be creative!</p>

			<p><strong>Each Student's Project Will Consist Of Two Parts:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>A responsive website or single-page web application.</li>
				<li>A final presentation on the project given to the rest of the class. The presentation is not graded; <strong>HOWEVER</strong>, your project will not be graded if you don't present on time.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p><strong>Deadlines:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Your website must be committed to your GitHub account by 6 p.m. on Wednesday, 5/11/16.</li>
				<li>Your presentation must also be given during class on Wednesday, 5/11/16.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p><strong>If You Choose To Build A Responsive Website, Your Site Must:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Have at least three responsive breakpoints starting at a 320px-wide resolution, and have content or layout that responds differently to each.</li>
				<li>Have at least three pages, all of which can be accessed from within the site's navigation.</li>
				<li>Include at least two pieces of JavaScript-enabled functionality or interaction that demonstrate JS concepts learned in class.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p><strong>If You Choose To Build A Single-page Web Application, Your App Must:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Display correctly from a 320px-wide resolution to a 768px-wide resolution.</li>
				<li>Have at least three JavaScript-enabled “panels”.</li>
				<li>Include at least two pieces of JavaScript-enabled functionality that demonstrate JS concepts learned in class, in addition to the panel-switching functionality from the previous requirement.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p><strong>More Project Requirements:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>All HTML and CSS code must validate and meet HTML5/CSS3 markup requirements (valid doctype, proper browser prefixes, required title and meta tags in place, etc.)</li>
				<li>No JavaScript console errors.</li>
				<li>Must include at least two mobile design patterns.</li>
				<li>Must include at least two images, both of which must adapt to the layout (using responsive image techniques).</li>
				<li>Must use percentages or relative units of measure for all layout and text styles.</li>
				<li>Must include at least two "quick win" techniques, as discussed in class.</li>
				<li>Must include at least one performance enhancement (proper JS/CSS file placement, responsive images, minified/concatenated source code, etc.).</li>
				<li>Demonstrate understanding of Git principles, including project forking, cloning, and frequent code commits and pushes.</li> 
				<li>Must be submitted to GitHub before the deadline.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p><strong>A Few Suggestions:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>You will not be graded on your site's design, but I do expect you to put in the effort to make your site aesthetically pleasing.</li>
				<li>Use of frameworks or plugins is not allowed. I need to be able to determine what you've learned in class, including coding abilities and adherance to best practices. If you're overreliant on frameworks or plugins, it will be difficult for me to assess your core competencies.</li>
				<li>Aside from class cancellation, there are no makeups for presentations. If you are unable to present on 5/11/16, let me know well in advance so you can present early.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p><strong>Your Presentation:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Each student will be given 10 minutes to present. Any time not used for the presentation will be given to questions from your peers or the instructor.</li>
				<li>The instructor will give warnings when 5 minutes and 1 minute are remaining.</li>
				<li>Think of your presentation as a code review for your peers. This is not a client demonstration; it is your opportunity to demonstrate your project’s code and functionality, and to explain its strengths and areas for improvement to other developers.</li>
				<li>Your presentation should answer three questions:
					<ul>
						<li>What is the problem your site or web app is trying to solve (i.e., what is the purpose of your project as it relates to mobile web development)?</li>
						<li>What is one area of code you are especially proud of?</li>
						<li>What is one area of code that has room for improvement, and how would you make that improvement? (i.e., given an unlimited amount of time, what additional design improvements or functionality would you include to enhance or improve your project?)</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Must be a demonstration of the site AND its code.</li>
				<li>Presentations will be done via the classroom computer and overhead projector. Additional presentation materials (such as slide presentations or handouts) are welcome, but not required.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p><strong>Grading:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Responsive website or single-page web application: 100 points</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p><strong>Extra Credit:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Up to 10 extra credit points will be awarded to projects that go above and beyond the basic requirements, at the instructor’s discretion. If this additional work is subtle or not immediately obvious in the final site, be sure to mention it in your presentation.</li>
				<li>This can include, but is not limited to:
					<ul>
						<li>Extra effort and attention to detail on the site's design and aesthetics.</li>
						<li>Proper use of advanced HTML5 and CSS3 techniques.</li>
						<li>Additional, substantial JavaScript or CSS3 functionality.</li>
						<li>A creative or unique presentation.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Any extra efforts that aren't totally obvious should be mentioned during your presentation if you want to receive points for them.</li>
				<li>Extra credit points will be given at the instructor's discretion.</li>
			</ul>
