# WEB234 Final Project
This is the starter repo for the WEB234 final project. It contains this README file, which includes the instructions and requirements for the final project.

Please fork this repo to your own GitHub account before cloning to your computer. All work should be committed and pushed back to your account on a regular basis. Remember to commit (and push) early and often! 

## Description
The purpose of the final project is to allow you to demonstrate the skills youâ€™ve learned in WEB234 by creating a responsive web site or single-page web application of your choosing. The project can be based on any class-appropriate topic, but MUST be approved by the instructor first. Suggested topics for the project include: hobbies, family sites, small business/portfolio sites, conceptual client sites, small web applications, etc. Be creative!

Each student's project will consist of two parts:

1. A responsive website **OR** single-page web application.
2. A final presentation on the project given to the rest of the class. The presentation is not graded; however, your project will **not** be graded if you don't present on time.

## Deadlines
1. Your website must be committed to your GitHub account by **6 p.m. on Wednesday, 5/11/16**.
2. Your presentation must also be given during class on **Wednesday, 5/11/16**.
