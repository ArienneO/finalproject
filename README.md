## Description
The purpose of the final project is to allow you to demonstrate the skills youâ€™ve learned in WEB234 by creating a responsive web site or single-page web application of your choosing. The project can be based on any class-appropriate topic, but MUST be approved by the instructor first. Suggested topics for the project include: hobbies, family sites, small business/portfolio sites, conceptual client sites, small web applications, etc. Be creative!

Each Student's Project Will Consist Of Two Parts:

1. A responsive website or single-page web application.
2. A final presentation on the project given to the rest of the class. The presentation is not graded; **HOWEVER**, your project will not be graded if you don't present on time.
